Chief Complaint

John Mickel is a 32-year-old male seen previously on 10/24/2017 at the Smith Family Clinic for
Genomic Medicine for genetics evaluation of failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and frequent
infections. At that time, whole genome sequencing was ordered. Mr. Mickel joins Dr. David Bick,
geneticist, and Whitley Kelley, MS, CGC, genetic counselor, by phone to discuss the results of that
testing. Mr. Mickel reports that there has been no overall change in his symptomatology since his
previous appointment. He states he is still thin at 108 lbs, with minimal fat and muscle. He reports
continuing low appetite and fatigue, but decreased vomiting. Mr. Mickel also reports that he still
has small warts on his hands and recently took fluconozole for a chest rash.

Assessment

Diagnosis

John Mickel is a 32-year-old male with a history of failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and
frequent infections. He previously underwent whole genome sequencing in an effort to provide a
genetic diagnosis for these symptoms, and these results were discussed via phone today.
 
Mr. Mickel's whole genome sequencing report did not include any primary findings, or findings
related to the indication for testing. We discussed that this does not rule out a genetic cause for his
symptoms. It is possible that upon future reanalysis of Mr. Mickel's whole genome sequencing
data, more information regarding a genetic reason for his symptoms could be uncovered as
medical knowledge improves over time. At this time, the genetic etiology for his condition remains
unknown.
 
We also discussed Mr. Mickel's secondary results, or results not related to the indication for
testing. His results indicated that he is an unaffected carrier for five autosomal recessive
conditions. The first variant, in the ALDOB gene (c.448G>C, p.Ala150Pro, pathogenic), is
associated with autosomal recessive hereditary fructose intolerance. This is a disorder in which
fructose is unable to be properly metabolized and can lead to severe gastrointestinal and
neurodevelopmental symptoms if left untreated. Mr. Mickel reports that this was at one time on the
differential for his symptoms, but that fructose avoidance showed no improvement. We
emphasized that though this condition was once on the differential for him, affected individuals
would be expected to have two variants in ALDOB, where Mr. Mickel only has one. This means
that he is an unaffected carrier of this condition and that this variant is not expected to be related
to his current symptoms.
 
The second variant, in the GJB2 gene (c.35delG, p.Gly12ValfsTer2, pathogenic), is associated
with autosomal recessive deafness. Variation in this gene is the most common form of non-

syndromic hereditary deafness. The third variant, in the GYG1 gene (c.304G>C, p.Asp102His,
pathogenic), is associated with autosomal recessive polyglucosan body myopathy. This is a slowly
progressive condition characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy as well as particular findings
on muscle biopsy. The fourth variant, in the DNASE2 gene (c.87-2A>G, likely pathogenic), is
associated with DNase II deficiency, which has recently been linked to type I interferon-mediated
autoinflammation (PMID: 29259162). The fifth variant, in the MGME1 gene (c.-60+1G>C, likely
pathogenic), is associated with autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome type
11. This condition includes many traditional features of mitochondrial disorders including
neurologic and neuromuscular complications and other multisystem symptoms.
 
We reviewed that being a carrier for these conditions is unlikely to affect Mr. Mickel's health, but it
could be important information in decisions about family planning and for other family members.
We discussed that knowing Mr. Mickel is a carrier for these conditions means that his siblings and
other family members could also be carriers. We reviewed that although carriers do not have
symptoms of a disorder, if they have children with a person who is a carrier for the same disease,
each child has a 25% chance to be affected. We reviewed that family members who wish to find
out if they are carriers for these disease can have targeted genetic testing, which looks at only the
specific locations identified in Mr. Mickel to see if the variant is present or absent in them.
 
We also discussed Mr. Mickel's pharmacogenomic results. Pharmacogenomics refers to genomic
variation that can impact the metabolism of certain medications. His results indicated that he may
have altered metabolism of amitryptyline, citalopram, escitalopram, ribavarin, PEG interferon-alfa-
2b, PEG interferon-alfa-2a, telaprevir, atazanavir, and ritonavir, and that further consideration
should be given to dosing or usage of these medications. We emphasized that decisions regarding
changes in usage or dosing of medications should be made by Mr. Mickel's physician. There are
other factors which influence a physician's decision to prescribe a certain drug or dose beyond
pharmacogenetics. See laboratory report for more information.

Plan

Care Plan

Mr. Mickel is encouraged to contact our clinic in approximately two years to initiate a reanalysis of
his whole genome sequencing data.
