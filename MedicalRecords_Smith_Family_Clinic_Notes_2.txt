Chief Complaint

John Mickel is a 32-year-old Caucasian male sent by Dr. Jonathan Ellis for genetics evaluation of
failure to thrive and possible undiagnosed metabolic condition.  He was seen by Dr. David Bick,
geneticist, and Meagan Cochran, genetic counselor.  Mr. Mickel was unaccompanied to his
appointment.
 
Mr. Mickel reports that he has had failure to thrive since infancy.  He reports that he was always a
picky eater then stopped eating around 18 months to 2 years old; he reports recurrent vomiting
around this time.  He reports that he had eating problems throughout his toddler years and was
always thin.  Since that time, Mr. Mickel reports he has always had trouble gaining weight; he has
had a maximum weight of 110 pounds with minimum of 95.  He reports lifelong abdominal pain. 
He has tried a number of different diets to improve his symptoms including dairy free, gluten free,
and fructose free; he has also tried drinking nutritional supplements such as Ensure with no
success.  He developed vomiting in his 20s and reports that he would vomit 3-4 times daily; he
was on benzodiazepine at the time. He was seen by Dr. Pasricha at John Hopkins and had an
extensive workup including a small bowel biopsy and endoscopy; these were unrevealing aside
from mild inflammation on endoscopy.  He was found to have delayed transit time in the small
intestine (10 hours vs. normal 6 hours) and delay in normal re-acidification of the stomach. He had
abnormal antroduodenal manometry was ultimately diagnosed with visceral hypersensitivity.  He
had his uvula shortened, which decreased his vomiting to the point that he was able to discontinue
benzodiazepine.  At present he reports that he does not have vomiting and is able to eat enough
to maintain his weight.  He can gain weight on Remeron but is not currently on this medication. 
He has 1-2 bowel movements each day and reports that they are well formed. 
 
Mr. Mickel has a history of spinal injury with L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc herniation.  He has been treated
with autologous adipose stem cell injections.  He states that during harvesting of adipose tissue
from his buttocks, he has been told that he has very little fat.  He has difficulty gaining muscle
mass even after working out and lifting weights.  He has joint hypermobility which he attributes to
low muscle mass and lack of joint support; he reports that he has dislocated his shoulder multiple
times.
 
Mr. Mickel reports frequent urination; he goes between 6 and 20 times per day and wakes 12-15
times at night.  He has very little urine each time and reports that it takes him a long time to go (10
-15 minutes).  He has hyperhidrosis of the hands and feet.  He does not have orthostatic
hypertension.  He has frequent skin infections including staph infections, fungal infections, and
herpes mouth sores.  He has had hundreds of what he describes as "warts" on his hands and has
been treated with cryotherapy and then Gardasil vaccine; he states that all but a few have
resolved since the vaccination.  Mr. Mickel reports that he has anxiety and depression; he is not
currently on medication.

Mr. Mickel has previously had extensive testing including biochemical and metabolic testing,
mitochondrial sequencing and deletion testing, and clinical whole exome sequencing.  His exome
sequencing revealed two variants in ALDOB, associated with hereditary fructose intolerance.  Mr.
Mickel subsequently went on a no fructose diet and experienced no improvement in symptoms,
leading his local geneticist to conclude that this was not a likely diagnosis for him.

Assessment

Diagnosis

John Mickel is a 32-year-old male with a history of failure to thrive, inability to gain muscle mass,
recurrent skin infection, decrease body fat, urinary frequency, hyperhidrosis, presently
underweight with visceral hypersensitivity.  He has previously had an extensive workup that was
unrevealing, including clinical whole exome sequencing.  Given his longstanding history of
unexplained symptoms, we recommend whole genome sequencing for Mr. Mickel.  Identifying an
underlying genetic diagnosis may provide information about management, prognosis, and
recurrence risk.
 
I personally reviewed Mr. Mickel's medical records including clinic notes, genetic testing results,
and biochemical/metabolic testing results.  I spent 108 minutes in face-to-face consult with Mr.
Mickel, over 50% of which was spent in counseling and coordination of care.  We offered Mr.
Mickel the opportunity to enroll in a HudsonAlpha research study for patients of the Smith Family
Clinic for Genomic Medicine.

R64 Cachexia

Plan

Care Plan

After considering his options, Mr. Mickel elected to proceed with whole genome sequencing and
receive all possible secondary findings.  This test takes approximately 3 months to complete, and
we will contact Mr. Mickel when results are available.
